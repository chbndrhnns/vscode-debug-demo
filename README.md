# vscode-debug-demo

This repository contains a simple Python project for demonstrating the debugging functions in Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

There are at least three ways to get started:

### Run everything in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces

You can open this repository in GitHub Codespaces to start exploring the debugging features.
This requires a free GitHub account.

### Run example locally

If you want to run the project on your local machine:

- clone it
- create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`)
- activate the virtual environment (e.g. `source .venv/bin/activate`)
- install the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- (opt.) run the webserver: `python -m src.app`

### Run single file locally

If you prefer to not have the webserver overhead, copy `src/core.py` into your editor and get started
from there.

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
python src/app.py
```
